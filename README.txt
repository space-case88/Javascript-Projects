This is a repository that is being used for my Tech Academy course for Javascript. It is from here that you can see what I have been working on.

So far in this repository, there are several projects that I have either completed or started and will continue to work on later. 

There is the Pizza restauraunt menu. This showcases the use of a list of items and the JS used to make a functioning menu to build a pizza and gather the cost.

I also built a functioning tic tac toe game. It works just like the classic game would but instead of going against another person you are up against the computer. It determines who goes first with a dice roll. It is complete with sound effects, images and animations.

In this folder is also a functioning calculator that I built. It does the four basic functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
